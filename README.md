## ðŸ§  What is BrewNet?

**BrewNet** is a **location-based social networking web app** that helps people **connect with others who are currently in the same cafÃ©**.

Imagine you walk into a cafÃ©â€”there could be 10, 20, or even 50 people around you, but you donâ€™t know who they are, what they do, or whether you share any interests. What if there was a way to discover that? Thatâ€™s what **BrewNet** enables.

It's designed for people who love the vibe of cafÃ©s but also wish they could connect with like-minded individuals sitting just a few tables away. Whether youâ€™re a student, freelancer, founder, designer, or just someone open to networkingâ€”**BrewNet creates opportunities for real, meaningful connections in real-time.**

## â˜• Why BrewNet?

In todayâ€™s world, most networking is either:
- **Too professional** (LinkedIn, conferences)
- **Too random** (Tinder, Bumble)
- **Too virtual** (Zoom, online events)

But real connections often start **casually**, in **shared spaces**â€”like cafÃ©s. BrewNet makes it easy and non-intrusive to connect with people **physically near you**, without awkwardness or cold approaches.

## ðŸ“² How It Works

1. **Sign In**  
   Users log in using Google authentication.

2. **Quick Onboarding**  
   They select their **name**, **gender**, and **interests** (like startups, design, tech, writing, etc.).

3. **Enter the CafÃ©**  
   Once inside a registered cafÃ©, users get access to a **home page** showing other BrewNet users present in the same cafÃ©.

4. **Discover People Nearby**  
   Browse profiles of people currently sitting around you â€” their name, interests, and a short bio (if any).

5. **Send Connection Requests**  
   Found someone interesting? Tap to send a request.

6. **Chat Privately**  
   Once the other person accepts, a private chat opens where you can talk and eventually meet in person.

## ðŸ’¡ What Makes It Unique

- **Real-Time + Real-World Networking**: Connect with people who are physically present around you.
- **Low Social Pressure**: No cold walking up to someoneâ€”just send a request, chat first, and meet if thereâ€™s a vibe.
- **Interest-Based Discovery**: Helps you find people aligned with your goals or passions.
- **Privacy-First Design**: Only active users in the cafÃ© are visible. Once you leave, your presence is hidden.
